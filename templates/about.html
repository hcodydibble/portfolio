    <div class='about-me middle'>
        <p>I am a software developer in Seattle, currently seeking a career as a full-stack or backend engineer in the United States. I fell in love with programming while attending Code Fellows, an intensive coding bootcamp, and now spend my time messing around with various projects and studying new languages. While not working with code I enjoy playing games or baking.</p>
